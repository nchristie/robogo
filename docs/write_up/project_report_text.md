I. Introduction
The ancient Chinese boardgame Go has attracted lots of media attention in recent years following Google's success in writing Artificial Intelligence capable of beating the world's best human Go player [SOURCE]. While there are many resources to play Go online both against other humans and against computers [SOURCE] there are fewer resources aimed at assisting beginners to understand the rules. Gomoku [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku] is a variation of the game in which the aim is to place five stones in a row before one's opponent manages to get five in a row. All the other remaining rules of the game were, however, maintained. On investigation this variation of the game appears to be an adaption of Gomoku , in which the capture rules aren't upheld. While there are resources to play Gomoku against computers online [https://gomokuonline.com/, https://gomoku.yjyao.com/] on investigation I could not find this unusual variation in which capture rules are upheld available.
