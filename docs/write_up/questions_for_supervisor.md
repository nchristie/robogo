Q - How to I make this project unique? Is five-in-a-row with captures enough?
Main thing is discussion of how I've programmed it

Q - How much is my code going to be looked at during marking?
It will be considered, structure, is it being used the best way
Do you deal with errors in a good way

Q - If I don't cite traditional sources such as journals is that going to be acceptable?
Just say what I've used to learn this, okay if they're not academic resources

Q - How likely am I to get an extension with my EC claim?
Might happen, talk to admin. Try to get something done but could save the submit for later

Q - Two-player game project write up
Look online

Notes on chat:
- Report should have two sections, one for user and one for coder: i.e. how the code works under the hood
- Try to implement alpha-beta; computer will check every possible move 5-6 moves in advance

- Write up report for now, when I revise I can say how I changed things. Can also say what I would do to improve

- Explain the code, how it's structured and how it works, lots of people make it too complex, so if I can generally explain how it works that is good. Not too many code examples, but general explanation of how it's structured and how it works
- Generalised code which could be used for any two-player game is a good way to do it

- Send a zip file with the code
